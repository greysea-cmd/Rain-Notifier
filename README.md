# Rain-Notification-App
The app will work in the background and send you notifications even when the browser tab isn't active, making it perfect for staying informed about rain conditions in your area!
## Features:

**Location Detection**: Uses your browser's geolocation to get your current position
**Rain Monitoring**: Checks weather conditions every 2 minutes when active
**Smart Notifications**: Alerts you only when rain starts or stops (not continuously)
**Browser Notifications**: Sends system notifications even when the tab isn't active

## How to use:

**Enable Location**: The app will ask for location permission
**Enable Notifications**: Click the notification button to allow browser alerts
**Start Monitoring**: Click "Start Monitoring" to begin rain detection
**Automatic Alerts**: You'll get notified when rain starts/stops

For real weather data, you'd need to:

- Get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap
- Replace the mock data section with actual API calls
- Add your API key to the weather API URL
